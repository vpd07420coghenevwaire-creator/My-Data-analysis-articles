Today I explored some really handy Excel tools and functions:
Arrays – work with multiple values at once
UNIQUE & SORT – remove duplicates and organize data
SUMPRODUCT – multiply and sum values in one go
VLOOKUP / XLOOKUP – find and pull data quickly
Text functions (LEFT, MID, DATE, FIND) – extract and work with text
It’s still a lot to take in 😅, but I’m slowly seeing how these functions can make analyzing data so much easier. Day by day, Excel is starting to feel less intimidating and more like a tool I can actually use.
