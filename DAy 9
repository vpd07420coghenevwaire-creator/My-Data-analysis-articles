Today was my introduction to formulas and functions in Excel — statistical functions, logical functions and more.
To be honest, it’s a completely new way of thinking for me, and I’m still trying to fully understand it. At some points, my brain really had to pause and process. 😅
But I’m reminding myself that learning something new is supposed to feel this way. With more practice, it will definitely get better.
