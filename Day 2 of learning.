Today I explored descriptive statistics and its types whic are measures of central tendency and measures of spread.
Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode.
Measures of spread: range, standard deviation, interquartile range.
Its exciting to know how these concepts apply in real world situations e.g In business, they show typical experiences, spot outliers, and help make smarter decisions.
