Today was all about Charts in Excel - turning raw data into visuals that actually make sense.

Here are the main ones I explorEd:

Bar/Column Chart - Shows clear comparisons between different categories.
Line Chart - Displays trends and changes over time.
Pie Chart - Shows how each part contributes to a whole.
Area Chart - Emphasizes the magnitude of change over time.
Scatter Plot - Reveals relationships or correlations between two variables.
