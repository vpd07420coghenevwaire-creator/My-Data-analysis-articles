Day 8 of my Data Analytics Journey.

Today, I started exploring Excel, one of the most powerful tools for data analysis.

I learned the basics - what a workbook and worksheet are, what rows and columns mean, how the ribbon works, and even tried out some formulas.

Excel may look simple at first, but it really helps you organize, explore, and understand data, skills every data analyst needs.
