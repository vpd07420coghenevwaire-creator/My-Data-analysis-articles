Day 5 of my journey: Time series Analysis.
Time series analysis is basically looking at data over time to see what’s going on.

It shows how things change e.g sales, website traffic, or even the weather. 
By noticing trends, growth or drops, and seasonal patterns, you can predict what might happen next.

That is why businesses, investors, and marketers use it - to plan ahead, adjust strategies, and make smarter decisions.

Key takeaway: Paying attention to past patterns makes it easier to figure out the future.
