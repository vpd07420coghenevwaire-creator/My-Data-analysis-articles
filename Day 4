Day 4 of my data analytics journey: 𝐇𝐲𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐬 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬.

Ever wonder if a new strategy is actually working or if a change really made an impact? That is where hypothesis testing comes in.

𝐇𝐲𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐬 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: a statistical method to check if a change or intervention has an effect. It involves making an educated guess and testing it with data to see if it is true.

Every test has two parts:
• Null hypothesis (H₀) - nothing changed
• Alternative hypothesis (H₁) - something changed or had an effect
For example, a hospital introduces a new nutrition protocol:
• Null hypothesis - the protocol doesn’t improve recovery
• Alternative hypothesis - the protocol does improve recovery.
After testing, we can see if the improvement is real or just happened by chance.

𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: shows how variables are connected, how a change in one affects the other and can help predict future results.

Key takeaway:
Hypothesis testing ensures decisions are based on facts, not assumptions.
Regression analysis helps us see connections and predict what might happen next, so we can make smarter decisions.
